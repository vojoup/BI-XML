            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="property">
               <h3>Background</h3>
               <p>Prior to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, the Inca ruled northern Chile
                  while an
                  indigenous people, the Mapuche, inhabited central and southern Chile. Although Chile
                  declared its
                  independence in 1810, it did not achieve decisive victory over the Spanish until 1818.
                  In the War of the
                  Pacific (1879-83), Chile defeated Peru and Bolivia to win its present northern regions.
                  In the 1880s,
                  the Chilean central government gained control over the central and southern regions
                  inhabited by the
                  Mapuche. After a series of elected governments, the three-year-old Marxist government
                  of Salvador
                  ALLENDE was overthrown in 1973 by a military coup led by General Augusto PINOCHET,
                  who ruled until a
                  democratically-elected president was inaugurated in 1990. Sound economic policies,
                  maintained
                  consistently since the 1980s, contributed to steady growth, reduced poverty rates
                  by over half, and
                  helped secure the country's commitment to democratic and representative government.
                  Chile has
                  increasingly assumed regional and international leadership roles befitting its status
                  as a stable,
                  democratic nation.

                  to
                  immigrants since transitioning to democracy in 1990 and improving its economic stability
                  (other regional
                  destinations have concurrently experienced deteriorating economic and political conditions).
                  Most of
                  Chile's small but growing foreign-born population consists of transplants from other
                  Latin American
                  countries, especially Peru.

               <p>In 2014, President Michelle BACHELET introduced tax reforms aimed at delivering her
                  campaign promise
                  to fight inequality and to provide access to education and health care. The reforms
                  are expected to
                  generate additional tax revenues equal to 3% of Chile’s GDP, mostly by increasing
                  corporate tax rates to
                  OECD averages.
